# Spectrum Sensing
Development repository for the [SDR in ORBIT: Spectrum Sensing](http://www.orbit-lab.org/wiki/Other/Summer/2015/aSDR2#SDRinORBIT:SpectrumSensing) project, part of the WINLAB Summer Internship 2015.

### Introduction
Spectrum sensing is the systematic scanning of the available radio frequency spectrum for areas of high usage. Our project involves the use of Universal Software Radio Peripherals (USRPs) in ORBIT to detect which frequencies are in use at any given time. Using WINLAB's Wiserd framework and MATLAB/Octave for signal processing, we aim to detect with optimal speed and efficiency the frequency of any signal transmitted from an unknown source. Accomplishing this goal will help to identify available bands in the frequency spectrum, giving opportunities for more efficient usage.
